# What is Web Scraping?
Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website. Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database. The scraper can then replicate entire website content elsewhere.

# Uses:
Web scraping is used in a variety of digital businesses that rely on data harvesting. Legitimate use cases include:

Search engine bots crawling a site, analyzing its content and then ranking it.
Price comparison sites deploying bots to auto-fetch prices and product descriptions for allied seller websites.
Market research companies using scrapers to pull data from forums and social media (e.g., for sentiment analysis).

# Scraper tools and bots
Web scraping tools are software (i.e., bots) programmed to sift through databases and extract information. A variety of bot types are used, many being fully customizable to:

Recognize unique HTML site structures
Extract and transform content
Store scraped data
Extract data from APIs
