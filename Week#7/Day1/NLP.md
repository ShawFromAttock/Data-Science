# Natural Language Processing (NLP):

A subfield of artificial intelligence called "natural language processing" (NLP) enables computers to comprehend, analyse, and modify human language. To bridge the gap between human communication and machine comprehension, NLP depends on a variety of academic fields, including computer science and computational linguistics.
## What are its applications in real life?

### `Sentiment Analysis`
Given that people frequently utilise sarcasm and irony, interpreting natural language in the context of opinions is extremely challenging for robots. Sentiment analysis, on the other hand, may spot small variations in emotions and attitudes and assess their positivity or negativity.

### `Text Classification`

Automatically comprehending, analysing, and classifying unstructured text is the task of text classification, a text analysis problem that also incorporates sentiment analysis.

### `Text Summarization`
The concept of automatic summarization is quite clear. It provides a text summary by highlighting the key points. Its major objective is to make it easier to browse through massive volumes of data, including scientific publications, news articles, and legal documents.

### `Auto-Correct`
Natural Language Processing plays a vital role in grammar checking software and auto-correct functions. Tools like Grammarly, for example, use NLP to help you improve your writing, by detecting grammar, spelling, or sentence structure errors. 

`..and many more`

Natural language processing (NLP), which entails converting spoken language into a machine-readable format, includes the area of natural language understanding (NLU).

# Natural Language Understanding (NLU):
Computers can quickly and automatically evaluate data using natural language understanding (NLU) and machine learning, saving organisations precious hours and resources when reviewing vast amounts of client input.

# Natural Language Generation (NLG):
NLG, or natural language generation, is an artificial intelligence-driven software process that creates natural written or spoken language from organised and unstructured data. Computers can communicate with users more effectively if they do so in human rather than computer language.
Natural Language Generation technology is enabled through a range of computer science processes. These include:

`Computational linguistics`

`Natural Language Processing (NLP)`

`Natural Language Understanding (NLU)`
