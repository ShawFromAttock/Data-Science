# Python:
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level, dynamically semantic programming language. It is particularly desirable for Rapid Application Development as well as for usage as a scripting or glue language to tie existing components together due to its high-level built-in data structures, dynamic typing, and dynamic binding.
### Printing in console:
```python
# This program prints Hello, world!

print('Hello, world!')
```
