# Probability
Probability is measure of likelihood of an event.

Examples are:
* Tossing of Coin
* Rolling a dise
* Weather forecast

There are two types of events:
### ***Mutual exclusive event:***
Only one outcome is possible.
### ***Non-mutual exclusive event:***
Multiple outcomes possible.
## Multiplicative rule:
Two types of events:
### ***Independent event:***
Probability of event remains same when event occurs.

Example: Tossing a coin.

Formula: P (A and B) =P (A) * P (B)
### ***Dependent event:***
Probability of event decreases with event occurrence.

Example: Taking a card from deck.

Formula: P (A and B) =P (A) * P (B/A)
