# Need for Data Science?
* Autopilot
* Airlines
* Logistics
* Better Decision Making
* Prediction and Pattern Recognition
# What is Data Science?
Its about asking the right questions, exploring data, modeling the data using algorithms, and communication and visualization of the results.
# Business Intelligence vs Data Science:
* Data is structured in BI and unstructured in DS.
* Analytical methods are used in BI and scientific in DS.
* We need statistical and visual skills in BI and for DI, we need statistical, visual and Machine Learning.
* In BI, we focus on past and present data, whereas in DI, we also deal with future data.
# Pre-requisites for Data Science:
* Curiosity
* Common Sense and Communication skills
* Machine Learning
* Mathematical Modeling
* Statistics
* Programming
* Database
# Tools and Skills:
* Python/ R: SAS Jupiter etc.
* Data Warehousing
* Data Visualization
* Machine Learning
# Job of a Data Scientist:
Real world -> Raw Data -> Process and Analyze -> Meaningful Data -> Useful insights
# Machine Learning Algorithms:
Regression-> Clustering -> Decision Tree -> Support Vector Machine -> Na√Øve Baiyes
# Life Cycle of Data Science:
* Concept Study.
* Data Preparation.
* Model Planning.

_**Model Planning**_ uses EDA which is deeper analysis of dataset for better understanding.
Model Building is done using test data sets and validating build model.
* Communication.
* Operationalize.
# Demand of a Data Scientist:
* Technology
* Gaming
* Marketing
* Finance
* Healthcare
